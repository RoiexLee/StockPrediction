```

## Usage

![home](./resource/home.png)

You can apply for a new APIKEY from [alphavanage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)

Next you just need to fill in the APIKEY and the stock name, then click the submit button

![data](./resource/data.png)

You can choose the model you want to use, and then click the submit button

![fit](./resource/fit.png)

It will show you the result of the model you choose

You can also try to predict future stock prices, but frankly, it's not accurate

![future](./resource/future.png)

The images that are the result are stored in [static/images](./static/images)

The models are stored in [static/models](./static/models)

You can train your models with [train_lstm.py](./train_lstm.py) and [train_xgboost.py](./train_xgboost.py)
